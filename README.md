## Lab Description
In this lab, we explored how to process and search through large text collections using core NLP techniques. We:
- Collected and cleaned a dataset of full-length books
- Tokenized and normalized the text
- Built an inverted index with positions
- Implemented phrase queries to find exact sequences of words across documents

This forms the foundation for how modern search engines and information retrieval systems work.

## Dataset Description
We used a custom dataset made up of 22 public domain books from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org). Each book is stored as a plain `.txt` file inside the `sample_docs/` folder.

- **Number of Documents**: 22 books  
- **File Format**: Plain text (`.txt`)  
- **Language**: English  
- **Source**: [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org)  
- **Vocabulary Size**: 2000+ unique words  

This dataset gives us a rich base for testing NLP techniques like indexing and phrase-based search.
